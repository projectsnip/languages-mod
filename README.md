# Contributing to Quix Language Files

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Quix language files! This guide will help you fork the project, add new translations, or update existing ones.

## How to Fork the Project

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page to create a copy under your GitHub account.

## Adding a New Language

1. **Locate the Language Files**: Go to the `administrator/` directory.

2. **Create a New Language File**: If your language isnâ€™t present, copy the `en-GB` file and rename it to match your language shorthand, such as `es-ES` for **Spanish**. Then modify the copied file with your translations.

3. **Add Your Translations**: Use the format below to add translations:
    ```ini
    COM_QUIX_SOME_KEY_DO_NOT_CHANGE_THE_KEY = "Your translation text"
    ```
   Repeat this process for the `site/` directory.

## Updating Existing Translations

1. **Locate the Language File**: Find the language file you wish to update.

2. **Edit the Translations**: Update the translation text while keeping the keys unchanged. For example:
    ```ini
    COM_QUIX_SOME_KEY_DO_NOT_CHANGE_THE_KEY = "Updated translation text"
    ```
